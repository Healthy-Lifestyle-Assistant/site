		<p class="lead mb-5">
			A healthy lifestyle is a way of living that lowers the risk of being seriously ill or dying early. Not
			all
			diseases are preventable, but a large portion of deaths, particularly those from coronary heart disease
			and lung
			cancer, can be avoided. Scientific studies have identified certain types of behavior that contribute to
			the
			development of noncommunicable diseases and early death. Health is not just about avoiding disease. It’s
			also
			about physical, mental and social wellbeing. When a healthy lifestyle is adopted, a more positive model
			is
			provided for other people in the family, particularly children.
			<br><br>
			Web application aims to support users to change their behavior and improve their health in order to live
			healthier, longer lives.
			<br><br>
			There're template exercises to pick off. You could also add your custom exercises with your media
			references
			(YouTube, articles, and so on). One or more exercises should be associated with workout. There’re also
			template
			workouts and the possibility to add custom workouts. <br><br>
			Mental health, relaxation, and spiritual activities can be found in the meditations section. Nutrition
			track is
			presented by recipes and supplements. <br><br>
			Once you’ve created a template or custom workout, nutrition event, or meditation, set a reminder to
			track it.

			<em>Web application is under development.</em>
